This is a small website that fetches the ten latest NASA's [Astronomy Picture of the Day](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) via NASA's API. 

The pictures are rendered in a nice list view. To learn more about a given picture click on the picture to render the gallery in a lightbox view. From within the lightbox view you can navigate the ten pictures, read the titles of the pictures, and learn more about what each picture is!
